### Project Title: BookSwap App.
# Approved

Project Idea Description: A money free Barter System market place where people can share their books on "1-1" swap basis.  Create localized communities both public and private, where users can join(public) or request membership(private) and Exit at any time as long as there are no dues. Communities may be formed among students, colleagues, neighbors etc. who can meet at convenience at public places or comfortable enough to invite home. Users can upload the list of books they are willing to share and a list of books/genres  they are interested in. Using ML, based on past “ratings” the app will recommend you with people with books you may like. Users can decide time and Space and can exchange books in the message window. Users rate each other upon completion of return based on maintenance of borrowed books and Filters can be set to optimize recommendations limiting to high rated users.    
      
Goal/Intended clients: Provide a safe a convenient and safe marketspace or all people who have books that are collecting dust on their shelves and due to sentiment or intended future use, the clients are not interested in selling them.  For all such users the app provides a safe space among familiar faces to exchange their books on temporary basis and get access to a wide range of books without  wasting money, especially if they hate ebooks and tablets like kindle, and love the feel of  a solid book in their hands and enjoy turning pages rather than swiping on screens . Revenue can be generated by charging membership fees or targeting added based on book preferences. No payment for books.
